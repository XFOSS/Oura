# Contributing

We welcome pull requests that improve the interpreter, documentation or
build system.  Please keep patches small and ensure `zig build mod-test` succeeds.

Steps for new contributors:

1. Fork the repository and create a feature branch.
2. Run `clang-format` on any C++ changes.
3. Add unit tests for new behaviour where possible.
4. Open a pull request describing the motivation for the change.

The project is experimental so discussions and design sketches are
encouragedâ€”feel free to file an issue to start a conversation.
