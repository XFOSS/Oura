# Oura

This repository contains experimental implementations of the OuroLang programming language.

## Building

A simple C++ interpreter is provided in `ouro_lang.cc`. You can build it using g++:

```bash
g++ -std=c++23 ouro_lang.cc -o ouro_lang
```

Then run the REPL:

```bash
./ouro_lang
```

A Zig build script is also included (`build.zig`) for environments with the Zig compiler installed.  It compiles the C/C++ sources using modern standards and links against LLVM.  Use it to build the entire project with:

```bash
zig build
```

The script also exposes tasks for running the module example and its unit tests.

## Repository Structure

The project includes a Zig-based build system, tests, container setup, and documentation. Invoke `zig build` to compile all targets.

## Zig Build with Modules

The `ouro_mod` directory showcases a minimal C++23 module setup. Build and run the modular example with:

```bash
zig build mod-run
```

Run its tests using:

```bash
zig build mod-test
```

## Documentation and Language Specification

Detailed design notes live in the `docs/` directory. The evolving language
specification is provided in `OuroLang_Spec_2_0.md` and outlines syntax,
semantics and concurrency features currently implemented. The specification now
includes a **Types** section describing primitive datatypes and short examples
of control flow. Community contributions are welcomeâ€”see `docs/contrib.md` for
guidelines.

## Fuzzing Tools

Experimental AFL++ harnesses live in `tools/fuzz`.  You can build the
lexer fuzzer with Zig and run it against the sample corpus in
`fuzz/corpus` to discover crashes in the lexer and parser:

```bash
zig build fuzz-lexer
./zig-out/bin/fuzz_lexer -i fuzz/corpus -o findings
```


## Legacy Ouroboros Sources

The `ouroboros-lang` directory tracks the original C implementation of the
language from the `FyreFly-TM/ouroboros-lang` project. Use the provided
Makefile to build the interpreter and run example scripts such as
`test_all_tokens.ouro`. Binary build artifacts and bundled `node_modules`
have been removed from version control.
